    Current status: **ALPHA**

## Alpha requirements

Anything that works (...or doesn't ðŸ¤·).

## Beta requirements

Good enough for tinkering and personal usage, and reasonably secure.

- [ ] Automated bare metal provisioning
    - [ ] Controller set up (Docker)
    - [ ] OS installation (PXE boot)
- [ ] Automated cluster creation (k3s)
- [ ] Automated application deployment (ArgoCD)
- [ ] Automated DNS management
- [ ] Initialize GitOps repository on Gitea automatically
- [ ] Observability
    - [ ] Monitoring
    - [ ] Logging
    - [ ] Alerting
- [ ] SSO
- [ ] Reasonably secure
    - [ ] Automated certificate management
    - [ ] Declarative secret management
    - [ ] Replace all default passwords with randomly generated ones
    - [ ] Expose services to the internet securely with Cloudflare Tunnel
- [ ] Only use open-source technologies (except external managed services in `./external`)
- [ ] Everything is defined as code
- [ ] Backup solution (3 copies, 2 seperate devices, 1 offsite)
- [ ] Define [SLOs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Service-level_objective):
    - [ ] 70% availability (might break in the weekend due to new experimentation)
- [ ] Core applications
    - [ ] Gitea
    - [ ] Woodpecker
    - [ ] Private container registry
    - [ ] Homepage

## Stable requirements

- [ ] Chaos testing
- [ ] Minimal dependency on external services
- [ ] Complete documentation
    - [ ] Diagram as code
    - [ ] Book (this book)
    - [ ] Walkthrough tutorial and feature demo (video)

- [ ] SLOs:
    - [ ] 99,9% availability (less than 9 hours of downtime per year)
    - [ ] 99,99% data durability
- [ ] Clear upgrade path
- [ ] Additional applications
    - [ ] Matrix with bridges
    - [ ] VPN server
