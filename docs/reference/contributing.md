# :material-handshake: Contributing

So, you've made it this far 🤓 Congrats! 🎉 I've primarily made this to document my own steps, but, having learned most of what I know today about software (and hardware) from open-source, I'm happy if you've found any of this code useful as well. If you want to contribute anything: fixes to code, configurations, documentation; like, literally, anything - you should definitely do so.

Steps:

- Open a [new issue](https://github.com/serpro69/ktchn8s/issues/new) 🆕
    - Totally optional. I'll accept PR's w/o an associated open issue, so long as it's clear what the code change is all about.
- Fork this repository 🍴
- Install dependencies (I guess you already have [nix shell](../concepts/development_shell.md) installed? 🤨)
- Bang your head against the keyboard from frustration 😡😤🤬 (Who said coding was easy?)
- Open a pull request once you're finished 😵‍💫
- Profit 🤑
