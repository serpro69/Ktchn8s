## About

This project utilizes [Infrastructure as Code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrastructure_as_code) and [GitOps](https://www.weave.works/technologies/gitops) to automate provisioning, operating, and updating self-hosted services in my homelab.
It can also be used as a framework to build your own homelab.

If you encounter an issue or want to contribute a fix or an improvement, please create [a bug issue](https://github.com/serpro69/ktchn8s/issues/new?template=bug.md).
<br>If you have a question or want to chat about this project, please create [a new discussion](https://github.com/serpro69/ktchn8s/discussions/new/choose).
