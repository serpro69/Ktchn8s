## About

This project utilizes [Infrastructure as Code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrastructure_as_code) and [GitOps](https://www.weave.works/technologies/gitops) to automate provisioning, operating, and updating self-hosted services in my homelab.
It can also be used as a framework to build your own homelab.

> **What is a homelab?**
>
> Homelab is the name given to a server (or multi-server) setup that resides locally in your home and where you host several applications, virtualized systems, containerized applications and so on, either for testing and developing, or for home and functional usage.
> The hardware you use can be anything from an old laptop, a simple tower or mini-PC, to a RaspberryPi-like device, to a repurposed professional server that you can acquire from companies who discard them due to their age but are still usable, a combination of all of these, or anything in between.
>
> See the [r/homelab introduction](https://www.reddit.com/r/homelab/wiki/introduction) for more information.
